  "question": "You are an expert architect with years of experience in climate and unique problem in the cyclone region of Odisha. I will give you problem, you will give multiple solutions for problem provided.\n\nWhat are the key consideration to be taken when planning roofing for a single storey building using earth techniques. We are particularly looking for solution created by Cyclone, Termite and rust.",
  "answer": "As an expert architect, I understand the challenges of designing a single-storey building using earth techniques in the cyclone region of Odisha. To address the concerns related to cyclone resistance, termite resistance, and rust protection, I am proposing multiple solutions for the roofing:\n\n1. Reinforced Earth Roof:\nCombine earth techniques with reinforcement materials like bamboo or steel to create a strong and durable roof. The reinforcement will help to resist cyclone forces, while a suitable treatment can be applied to protect against termites and rust.\n2. Green Roof:\nA green roof with plants and a waterproof membrane can be an option. The vegetation will help to dissipate wind forces and reduce roof uplift during cyclones. Ensure the use of termite-resistant materials for the structural components and rust-resistant coatings for any metal elements.\n3. Ferrocement Roof:\nConstruct a thin, lightweight ferrocement roof using a mix of cement, sand, and water with reinforcing mesh made of rust-resistant materials like galvanized or stainless steel. This will provide good resistance to cyclone forces, termite damage, and rust.\n4. Geodesic Dome Roof:\nA geodesic dome roof can offer improved resistance to cyclone forces due to its aerodynamic shape and inherent structural strength. Use termite-resistant materials for the dome's structural framework and apply rust-resistant coatings to any metal components.\n5. Vaulted Roof:\nA vaulted roof made of earth materials such as compressed earth blocks (CEB) or rammed earth can provide adequate cyclone resistance due to its curved shape. For termite resistance, incorporate natural additives like lime or cement in the earth mix. For rust protection, use rust-resistant reinforcements and coatings for metal elements.\n6. Combination of Earth and Local Materials:\nIncorporate locally available materials, such as palm fronds or thatch, with earth materials to create a hybrid roof. The natural materials can help to reduce wind uplift during cyclones, while proper treatment can protect against termite infestation. Use rust-resistant metal components for reinforcement.\n\nRegardless of the chosen solution, always prioritize proper anchorage of the roof to the walls and foundation, ensuring a continuous load path to transfer the forces down to the ground. Moreover, consult with local experts, engineers, and builders to ensure that the selected solution complies with local building codes and regulations.",
  "reasons": "The question is personalizable because it requires the architect to consider specific environmental conditions and local materials available in the cyclone region of Odisha. Different users (architects) would need to adapt their solutions based on the unique challenges of the location, such as the frequency and intensity of cyclones, the availability of termite-resistant materials, and the local building codes. Thus, the solutions must be tailored to the specific circumstances and resources of the user, making it personalizable.",

  "question": "her name is Shreya. let's use her name in each answer for a personalised response.\n\nhere is my review broadly - \nI was the founder of Chatpod and Shreya worked with me for about a year across different functions at my startup. She is a strong generalist, learns fast and her peak is in people management. Her ability to build bonds with the team was exceptional. She contributed in building the team from ground up, as we scaled from 3 people to over 20 people including interns and full time. People absolutely loved working with her and hence she didn't only add value with her creativity as a personal contributor but also as a team leader. She joined as an intern herself but quickly started managing the team. She became a leader without being given the title, and that's what I'd expect anyone in my team to do. She is a talented person with multiple interests outside of work which makes her a complete personality in a team. From dance to art to being active in social contributions, she's also an artist and that strongly adds to her generalist persona. She has immense discipline and focus on what she's doing. Be it personal or work, her intense discipline is inspiring for the entire team.\n\nIn future, I'd love to work with her again.

  "answer": "There are several differing expert perspectives on what the standards of care should be for transgender teenagers. Here, we will discuss three such perspectives from Dr. Jennifer Finlayson-Fife, Dr. Norman Spack, and Dr. Kenneth Zucker.\n\n1. Dr. Jennifer Finlayson-Fife:\nDr. Finlayson-Fife is a licensed psychotherapist and relationship coach, specializing in issues surrounding human sexuality and identity. She believes that the standard of care for transgender teenagers should involve a comprehensive approach, including individual and family therapy, education, and exploration of gender identity.\nQuote: \"The process of self-discovery and identity formation is critical for transgender teenagers, and a comprehensive approach allows them to navigate this journey with appropriate guidance and support.\"\n2. Dr. Norman Spack:\nDr. Spack is a pediatric endocrinologist and one of the pioneers in the medical treatment of transgender youth. He advocates for the use of hormone blockers to pause puberty in transgender teenagers, allowing them time to explore their gender identity without the distress of puberty-induced bodily changes.\nQuote: \"Puberty blockers can give transgender adolescents the opportunity to explore their gender identity and make informed decisions about their future, without the pressure of irreversible physical changes.\"\n3. Dr. Kenneth Zucker:\nDr. Zucker is a psychologist and former head of the Gender Identity Service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. He is known for his controversial approach to treating transgender youth, which involves exploring underlying psychological issues before considering medical interventions.\nQuote: \"It's important to address any potential underlying psychological factors before pursuing medical interventions, to ensure that adolescents are making informed and appropriate decisions about their gender identity.\"\n\nDrawing from these perspectives, an original point that responds to the experts' views could be: Standards of care for transgender teenagers should be individualized and multidisciplinary, involving a combination of psychotherapy, family support, and medical interventions as necessary. This approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of each adolescent's unique gender identity journey while considering their physical and emotional well-being. Collaboration between mental health professionals, endocrinologists, and other specialists ensures that transgender teenagers receive the most appropriate and supportive care, tailored to their individual needs.",

  "question": "Revise the above to go more in depth on each perspective in the style of a New Yorker essay.",
  "answer": "In recent years, society has come to recognize and understand the unique challenges faced by transgender individuals, particularly during adolescence. This period of life, marked by significant physical, emotional, and social changes, can be particularly challenging for transgender teenagers. A growing body of research and the development of specialized clinics aim to provide these young people with the care and support they need. However, there remains a diversity of opinion among experts regarding the most appropriate standards of care for transgender teenagers. In this essay, we delve into the perspectives of three experts in the field, exploring their backgrounds, methodologies, and philosophies.\n\nDr. Jennifer Finlayson-Fife, a licensed psychotherapist and relationship coach, advocates for a comprehensive and empathetic approach to treating transgender teenagers. With a background in human sexuality and identity, Dr. Finlayson-Fife is uniquely attuned to the challenges that transgender teenagers face in their journey towards self-discovery. She emphasizes the importance of individual and family therapy, as well as education and exploration of gender identity, as cornerstones of her approach.\n\nIn her perspective, the process of self-discovery is critical for transgender teenagers: \"The process of self-discovery and identity formation is critical for transgender teenagers, and a comprehensive approach allows them to navigate this journey with appropriate guidance and support.\" By weaving together these different components, Dr. Finlayson-Fife hopes to create a holistic support system that encourages personal growth and understanding, while also fostering a sense of belonging and resilience in transgender teenagers.\n\nDr. Norman Spack, a pioneering pediatric endocrinologist, champions a medical approach that incorporates the use of hormone blockers to pause puberty in transgender teenagers. Having co-founded the first clinic in the United States dedicated to the care of transgender youth, Dr. Spack has dedicated his career to helping these individuals find a sense of physical congruence with their gender identity.\n\nDr. Spack believes that hormone blockers provide transgender adolescents with the opportunity to explore their gender identity without the distress of puberty-induced bodily changes: \"Puberty blockers can give transgender adolescents the opportunity to explore their gender identity and make informed decisions about their future, without the pressure of irreversible physical changes.\" In Dr. Spack's view, this intervention allows young people the time and space to make informed decisions about their future, while minimizing the risk of regret and psychological distress.\n\nDr. Kenneth Zucker, a psychologist with a controversial approach to treating transgender youth, emphasizes the importance of considering potential underlying psychological factors before pursuing medical interventions. As the former head of the Gender Identity Service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Dr. Zucker has been at the center of heated debates in the field.\n\nDr. Zucker insists that a thorough exploration of any underlying psychological issues is a crucial step in the process: \"It's important to address any potential underlying psychological factors before pursuing medical interventions, to ensure that adolescents are making informed and appropriate decisions about their gender identity.\" Critics argue that his approach can be harmful, as it may inadvertently invalidate transgender teenagers' identities or even lead to conversion therapy-like practices.\n\nIn considering the perspectives of these three experts, it becomes clear that the standards of care for transgender teenagers should be individualized and multidisciplinary. A combined approach, incorporating psychotherapy, family support, and medical interventions as necessary, allows for a comprehensive exploration of each adolescent's unique gender identity journey while considering their physical and emotional well-being. By fostering collaboration between mental health professionals, endocrinologists, and other specialists, we can ensure that transgender teenagers receive the most appropriate and supportive care, tailored to their individual needs.",

  "question": "Discuss an invented story of a particular teenager and how each of the experts might treat that teen. What tensions arise as we try to combine these approaches?",
  "answer": "Once upon a time, in a small suburban town, lived a 14-year-old teenager named Jamie. Jamie, assigned female at birth, had been experiencing growing discomfort with their body and gender identity over the past few years. As they entered puberty, the distress intensified, and Jamie began to identify as transgender. Recognizing their child's struggles, Jamie's parents sought professional help to support Jamie through this challenging period.\n\nIf Jamie were to be treated by Dr. Jennifer Finlayson-Fife, the focus would be on a comprehensive and empathetic approach. Dr. Finlayson-Fife would engage Jamie in individual therapy sessions to explore their feelings about their gender identity, navigating the complexities of self-discovery. Additionally, she would involve the entire family in therapy sessions to ensure a supportive environment for Jamie, addressing any concerns or misconceptions held by the family members. Dr. Finlayson-Fife might also refer Jamie to educational resources and support groups to aid in the exploration of their gender identity.\n\nUnder Dr. Norman Spack's care, the emphasis would shift towards a medical approach. Dr. Spack would assess Jamie's suitability for hormone blockers, considering factors such as their mental health, family support, and the persistence of their gender dysphoria. If deemed appropriate, he would prescribe hormone blockers to pause Jamie's puberty, providing them with time to further explore their gender identity without the distress of unwanted physical changes. Dr. Spack might also collaborate with a mental health professional to ensure Jamie's emotional well-being during this process.\n\nShould Jamie visit Dr. Kenneth Zucker, they would encounter a more cautious approach. Dr. Zucker would first explore any potential underlying psychological factors that might contribute to Jamie's gender dysphoria before considering medical interventions. His treatment might involve encouraging Jamie to engage in activities and social situations that align with their assigned gender, aiming to help Jamie become more comfortable in their body. Dr. Zucker would emphasize the need for careful consideration before pursuing any medical interventions.\n\nAs we try to combine these approaches, several tensions arise. Dr. Finlayson-Fife's focus on comprehensive therapy and support may not directly address the physical aspects of Jamie's gender dysphoria, potentially leaving them feeling physically incongruent with their gender identity. Dr. Spack's medical approach, while alleviating physical distress, may not fully address the emotional and familial aspects of Jamie's journey. Dr. Zucker's cautious stance may inadvertently invalidate Jamie's feelings and identity, causing frustration and psychological distress.\n\nIn attempting to reconcile these approaches, it is crucial to maintain an individualized and multidisciplinary treatment plan for Jamie. A combined approach might involve beginning with Dr. Finlayson-Fife's comprehensive therapy and support, then assessing the need for medical interventions in collaboration with Dr. Spack. Dr. Zucker's cautious approach could be integrated by ensuring that all potential psychological factors are explored and addressed during the therapeutic process. By fostering collaboration between experts and tailoring treatment to Jamie's unique needs, the tensions between these approaches can be mitigated, ultimately providing Jamie with the most appropriate and supportive care.",

  "answer": "Determining if someone is a covert narcissist can be challenging, as their behaviors may be subtle or hidden. However, here are some signs that may indicate your dad could be a covert narcissist:\n\n1. Passive-aggressiveness: If your dad tends to express anger or frustration indirectly through behaviors like sulking, giving the silent treatment, or sabotaging others, he might exhibit covert narcissistic traits.\n2. Victim mentality: If he frequently sees himself as a victim and uses this perception to manipulate or gain sympathy from others, this could be a sign of covert narcissism.\n3. Envy: If he consistently feels envious of others' achievements or possessions and believes he is entitled to the same things without putting in the effort, it might indicate covert narcissistic tendencies.\n4. Hypersensitivity to criticism: Covert narcissists often react defensively or even aggressively to perceived criticism. If your dad can't handle even constructive feedback without overreacting, this might be a sign.\n5. Emotional manipulation: If your dad uses guilt, self-pity, or passive-aggressive tactics to control and manipulate the emotions of those around him, this could indicate covert narcissism.\n6. Low self-esteem: Covert narcissists often struggle with feelings of insecurity and low self-worth. If your dad seems to need constant validation and admiration but still struggles with self-esteem, it could be a sign.\n\nKeep in mind that everyone can exhibit some of these behaviors at times, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are a covert narcissist.

  "answer": "Introducing programming to a 9-year-old can be an exciting and rewarding experience. The key is to keep things simple, fun, and engaging. Here's a step-by-step approach to introduce Python programming to your daughter:\n\n1. Gauge her interest: Before diving into programming, have a casual conversation with your daughter about what programming is and why it's useful. Share examples of how programming can be used to create games, solve problems, or make cool projects.\n2. Get the right tools: Install Python on your computer and choose a beginner-friendly text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Thonny, Mu, or Visual Studio Code with the Python extension.\n3. Learn together: Make the learning process a joint effort, where both of you can explore and learn together. This way, she'll feel more comfortable asking questions, and you'll be better equipped to provide guidance.\n4. Start with the basics: Begin with simple concepts like variables, data types, and basic arithmetic operations. Use relatable examples and analogies to help her understand these concepts.\n5. Make it interactive: Introduce her to the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) or interactive mode, where she can enter code and see the results immediately. This will make the learning process more engaging and fun.\n6. Visual and creative projects: Kids love visuals, so consider introducing her to libraries like Turtle, which allows users to create graphics and animations using Python. This will enable her to see the immediate results of her code, making programming more enjoyable and tangible.\n7. Teach control structures: Gradually introduce more complex concepts like loops and conditional statements. Use real-life examples to help her understand how these concepts can be used to create more interesting and dynamic programs.\n8. Break down problems: Teach her how to break down problems into smaller, manageable tasks. This will help her think logically and systematically, which is essential for programming.\n9. Encourage experimentation: Encourage her to explore and experiment with code. Making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process, so remind her that it's okay to make errors and learn from them.\n10. Find additional resources: Utilize online tutorials, coding games, and apps like Scratch, Code.org, or Tynker to supplement her learning. Many resources cater to children and are designed to make coding enjoyable and engaging.\n\nRemember to be patient and offer support throughout the process. Encourage her to ask questions and explore new concepts. With the right approach, your daughter will develop a strong foundation in programming and have fun along the way.",

After years of working as a teacher and raising a loving family, I had finally retired and had the time to give back to my community. Relay for Life was one of my favorite events, and I couldn't wait to join in on the fun and support a good cause.\n\nThe aroma of fresh pizza wafted through the air, and my stomach rumbled with anticipation. I had been looking forward to this particular pizza all day. After organizing the fundraiser and ensuring everything ran smoothly, it was a small reward that I eagerly awaited.\n\nAs I approached the group of young people, I couldn't help but smile at their energy and enthusiasm. It warmed my heart to see them dedicating their time to something so meaningful. I decided to walk up and grab a slice of pizza for myself, eager to satisfy my hunger and join in the festivities.\n\nAs I walked behind a young man named Will, I noticed he was deep in conversation with his friend Matt. They seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I couldn't help but feel happy to see people bonding over such a positive event.\n\nSuddenly, Will turned slightly, and his elbow accidentally bumped into me. My hands, not as steady as they once were, lost their grip on the plate, and my precious pizza fell to the ground with a soft thud. I felt a pang of disappointment and couldn't help but exclaim, \"I can't eat THIS!\" It was a mixture of frustration and humor, as I knew nobody would force me to eat the fallen pizza, but it was a bit of a letdown after looking forward to it all day.\n\nWill and Matt quickly grabbed their pizzas and left, chuckling as they went. I couldn't help but laugh a little myself, remembering the countless times when similar mishaps had happened in my own youth. It was a small moment of connection that added some levity to the night.\n\nAfter grabbing a fresh slice of pizza, I joined my fellow volunteers and enjoyed the rest of the evening. The laughter and camaraderie were infectious, and as I watched the sun set, I felt grateful for my life, my community, and the opportunity to make a difference in the world.",

  "answer": "Title: \"A Candid Connection\"\n\nObjective:\nCapture an authentic and heartfelt conversation between a mother and her daughter discussing menstruation for the first time. This campaign aims to break down taboos and stigmas surrounding periods by encouraging openness and honesty, while acknowledging the staged setting. The focus is on the genuine connection between the mother and daughter, rather than creating an advertisement.\n\nLocation:\nA minimalistic film studio with a simple backdrop (white, gray, or soft pastel color) and appropriate lighting to emphasize the honesty of the conversation. The setting should be unpretentious and candid, reminding the viewer of the artificial nature of the setup while still maintaining an intimate atmosphere.\n\nTalent:\n\n1. Daughter: A young girl aged 11-13, about to have her first period. She should have a curious and innocent expression, embodying vulnerability and eagerness to learn.\n2. Mother: A woman in her 30s or 40s, with a warm and nurturing demeanor. She should convey a sense of wisdom, love, and understanding.\n\nVisuals:\n\n1. The campaign starts with a wide shot of the mother and daughter sitting in the film studio, facing each other with a small table between them. They are surrounded by essential period products, like pads or tampons, and a few props that help create a comfortable atmosphere.\n2. The daughter hesitantly asks her mother about her first period, displaying genuine curiosity and concern. The mother listens carefully, with a gentle smile, and begins to share her own experience.\n3. Medium shots of the mother and daughter engaging in conversation, with a focus on their facial expressions and body language. The mother offers advice on what to expect and how to manage it, while the daughter listens attentively and asks questions.\n4. Close-ups of the mother's hands demonstrating how to use the pad or tampon, using a prop to maintain discretion while still being informative.\n5. Intersperse shots of the daughter nodding, smiling, and occasionally laughing, showcasing her growing confidence and understanding.\n6. As the conversation progresses, the mother and daughter become more comfortable and relaxed, sharing candid moments and stories, emphasizing the genuine connection between them.\n7. Towards the end, the mother offers her daughter a 'period care package' with essentials like sanitary products, a heating pad, and chocolate. The daughter gratefully accepts the thoughtful gesture.\n8. The conversation ends with a sincere hug between the mother and daughter, symbolizing the unconditional love and support that transcends the challenges of growing up.\n\nAudio:\nNo background music, focusing solely on the mother and daughter's voices and their candid conversation. The mother's voice should be warm and comforting, while the daughter's voice should be curious and open to learning. Ambient studio sounds should be kept to a minimum to maintain the intimacy of the conversation.\n\nMessage:\nThe final shot fades into text that reads, \"Breaking taboos, one honest conversation at a time.\" The campaign encourages families to be more open about periods, fostering a culture of understanding and support for young girls entering womanhood. By acknowledging the artificial setup, the focus is placed on the real and unscripted connection between the mother and daughter, making the conversation relatable and authentic.",

To run them in parallel, you'll need to install `pytest-xdist`:\n```bash\npip install pytest-xdist\n```\nNow, let's create a simple example with a User model, a UserFactory, and a test suite:\n\n1. `models.py`: A simple User model using SQLAlchemy.\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    username = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)\n\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname')\nBase.metadata.create_all(engine)\n\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n```\n1. `factories.py`: A factory for the User model using factory\\_boy.\n```python\nimport factory\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\nfrom .models import User, Session as DbSession\n\nclass UserFactory(factory.alchemy.SQLAlchemyModelFactory):\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        sqlalchemy_session = DbSession()\n\n    id = factory.Sequence(lambda n: n)\n    username = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f'user_{n}')\n    email = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f'user_{n}@example.com')\n```\n1. `conftest.py`: A pytest fixture for creating a scoped session for the tests.\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom models import engine, Session\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope='function')\ndef db_session():\n    connection = engine.connect()\n    transaction = connection.begin()\n    session = Session(bind=connection)\n    yield session\n    session.close()\n    transaction.rollback()\n    connection.close()\n```\n1. `test_users.py`: A sample test suite that demonstrates parallel tests.\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom models import User\nfrom factories import UserFactory\n\ndef test_create_user(db_session):\n    user = UserFactory.create()\n    db_session.add(user)\n    db_session.commit()\n    assert db_session.query(User).count() == 1\n\ndef test_create_multiple_users(db_session):\n    users = UserFactory.create_batch(5)\n    db_session.add_all(users)\n    db_session.commit()\n    assert db_session.query(User).count() == 5\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"num_users\", [1, 5, 10])\ndef test_create_parametrized_users(db_session, num_users):\n    users = UserFactory.create_batch(num_users)\n    db_session.add_all(users)\n    db_session.commit()\n    assert db_session.query(User).count() == num_users\n```\nTo run the tests in parallel, use the following command:\n```bash\npytest -n <num_workers> test_users.py\n```\nReplace `<num_workers>` with the number of workers you want to run in parallel.",
  "reasons": "The question is personalizable because it involves specific user requirements and configurations for implementing test cases using `SQLAlchemy`, `factory_boy`, and `pytest` with a PostgreSQL backend. The user's environment, such as database credentials, schema, and specific test scenarios, will affect how the tests should be written and executed. Different users may have different database setups, schemas, or testing needs, which means the sample tests need to be tailored to their particular circumstances to be effective.",

  "question": "```ts\nfunction getMany(\n keys: KvKey[],\n options?: { consistency?: KvConsistencyLevel },\n): Promise[]>;\n```\n\nthis method takes an arbitrary array of keys, and returns a same length array of results. the results can each have a different type. i'd like to have it take a generic argument that lets me specify the value type for each kv entry result, and ensure that the output array's length is the same as the input array.",
  "answer": "You can achieve this by utilizing mapped types and tuple utility types in TypeScript. Here's how you can modify the `getMany` function to accept a generic argument that specifies the value type for each KV entry result and ensures that the output array's length is the same as the input array:\n```ts\ntype KvKey = string | number | symbol;\ntype KvConsistencyLevel = 'strong' | 'eventual';\ntype KvEntryMaybe<T> = T | null;\n\nfunction getMany<T extends unknown[]>(\n  keys: { [K in keyof T]: KvKey },\n  options?: { consistency?: KvConsistencyLevel },\n): Promise<{ [K in keyof T]: KvEntryMaybe<T[K]> }> {\n  // Your implementation here\n}\n```\nIn this modified version of the function:\n\n1. The generic argument `T` is extended from `unknown[]` which represents an array of unknown types.\n2. The `keys` parameter now uses mapped types `{ [K in keyof T]: KvKey }` to ensure that the number of keys matches the number of types specified in the generic `T`.\n3. The return type of the function is changed to `{ [K in keyof T]: KvEntryMaybe<T[K]> }`, which ensures that the length of the output array is the same as the input array, and each output type corresponds to the specified generic type for that KV entry result.\n\nNow, you can use the `getMany` function with a tuple of types for the generic argument:\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const [result1, result2] = await getMany<[string, number]>(['key1', 'key2']);\n  // result1 will be inferred as KvEntryMaybe<string>\n  // result2 will be inferred as KvEntryMaybe<number>\n}\n```",
  "reasons": "The question is personalizable because it involves specifying the value type for each KV entry result, which can vary greatly depending on the user's specific use case and data structure. Different users might have different types of data associated with their keys, and thus require a tailored solution that fits their particular needs. The solution must consider the user's specific key-value structure to ensure the function behaves as expected for their application.",

  "question": "i can not pass `as const` arrays to this function now",
  "answer": "Apologies for the confusion. To support passing `as const` arrays to the `getMany` function, you can adjust the generic constraints and make a slight modification to the function:\n```ts\ntype KvKey = string | number | symbol;\ntype KvConsistencyLevel = 'strong' | 'eventual';\ntype KvEntryMaybe<T> = T | null;\n\nfunction getMany<T extends readonly unknown[]>(\n  keys: readonly [...{ [K in keyof T]: KvKey }],\n  options?: { consistency?: KvConsistencyLevel },\n): Promise<{ [K in keyof T]: KvEntryMaybe<T[K]> }> {\n  // Your implementation here\n}\n\nasync function main() {\n  const [result1, result2] = await getMany(['key1', 'key2'] as const);\n  // result1 will be inferred as KvEntryMaybe<string>\n  // result2 will be inferred as KvEntryMaybe<string>\n}\n```\nHere's what changed:\n\n1. The generic argument `T` now extends `readonly unknown[]` instead of `unknown[]`. This change supports the use of `as const` arrays, which are treated as `readonly` tuples.\n2. The `keys` parameter now accepts a `readonly` array, specified as `readonly [...{ [K in keyof T]: KvKey }]`.\n\nNow, you should be able to pass `as const` arrays to the `getMany` function.",

  "question": "I have a company founded in colombia on march 2022. In the begining there were 3 co-founders and i payed in october 2022 an amount that was equivalent to 25% of the company. The company is named Celes. Celes is a SaaS B2B that connects to an ERP, analyzes the data and gives recommendations about what to purchases and when, besides, it provides helpful business intelligence reports and customer segmentation. Celes serves companies in the retail sector that benefit from this services as they can have lower stocks and a lower expectation of lost sales. \nThe company has been growing and currently we have 30.000 USD in MRR, an average 1000 USD revenue per client, 12 employees, we pay low salaries compared to the industry and we are not burning money (the incompe received is enough to pay for our current costs of servers, admin and payroll).\nWe are raising money to accelerate our growth and to increase the value provided by our product by hiring more developers, Technical Account Managers and Data Engineers. We expecto to raise $800.000 USD via SAFE from angles and institutional investors with a pre-money cap of $6.0000.000 USD. All this money will be received by a new c-corp company established in Delaware, US.\nWe contacted a company in ireland named Primeline that is a provider to 100% of the biggest retailers in ireland and have a very close relationship with them. They love our product and became a customer of their own.\nPrimeline proposed to invest 300.000 USD via SAFE on the terms that we are raising and were previously exposed. FOr this investment they are asking for a seat in oour board. Apart from that, we are working in a deal where we create a Joint Venture established in ireland called Primalytics. The owners of this Joint Venture will be Primeline (50%) AND Celes Delaware (50%). The purpose of this Joint Venture is to be the official seller of Celes in ireland where Celes Delaware provides the product and everything involved and Primeline will contact its clients so that they purchase Celes services via this JV.\nThe initial proposal was that the 2 companies would split the net revenue of this JV (Revenue after admin and fiscal costs are covered). I think that this deal is advantageous for primeline given that Celes will do all the work and Primeline has nothing to lose from this partnership but the average client in ireland would be at least 4.000 USD, which would provide a nice additional source of revenue for us even when we have to give 50% of the revenue for those deals and also would make the company more valueable given that the product would be proven to work in europe with big brands.\nNow primeline is proposing this:\n\n\"Primeline commits to Investment USD 300k into the Celes Delaware investment company directly. This investment to be returned to the Primalytics JV in Ireland to fund a sales and marketing team focused on growing ARR from EMEA. This represents 5% share in the business and would come with a board seat focused on growing the business.\nWe confirm a vesting vehicle that allows for 50% of the ARR generated out of the Primalytics JV to convert to Equity in Celes based on a 15 times ARR multiple. If Celes is sold for 20 times multiple Primeline’s 50% share of JV sales would convert at 15 times. If Celes is sold at below 15 times then Primeline would match the lower than 15 times multiple for conversion to shares.\nWe believe the focus on selling Celes in Europe and EMEA through the Irish JV will drive significant ARR value quickly.\nWe believe our extensive network into retailers and brands uniquely positions us to drive Celes ARR to USD 1m plus from EMEA.\"\n\nI dont think this is fair because i understand that they will increase the value of their 300kUSD investment inn Celes Delawere when the company sells more and additionally, each dollar sold in Ireland would give them more and more participation in the company. I might be wrong but i think this will give them a double winning while we are the ones doing all the work.\n\nThe co-founder leading the negotiation is proposing this:\n\n\"50% of the revenue from the JV, will be converted to equity at the series A valuation with a 20% discount. That would be like making a SAFE with a cap and discount that is typical from YCombinator\".\n\nI think it might be a sound counter proposal but i am not sure if it would give primeline an over advantageous benefit compared to standard or commom practices in this regard. I would very much like to have the JV with them because it would increase our revenue and the valuation of the company. I think Primeline is fundamental to enter that market. My way to defend this proposal is thinking we will receive capital in the way of the revenue that would otherwise go to Primeline and we will use that money before the series A, so giving additional equity for that money could be fair and the discount will recognize the decrease in value of that money at the time of the series A.\n\nPlease provide a proposal that will make primeline and me very confortable given the context provided. Please ask as many questions as you need about what you need to know to provide a comprehensive answer.",
  "answer": "I understand your concerns and the desire to create a mutually beneficial agreement with Primeline. Based on the information provided, I would suggest the following proposal:\n\n1. Primeline invests $300,000 in Celes Delaware via SAFE on the terms you previously mentioned with a pre-money cap of $6,000,000. This investment will grant Primeline a seat on the board.\n2. Celes Delaware and Primeline will form the Primalytics JV in Ireland, with each company owning 50% of the joint venture. The JV will be the exclusive seller of Celes in Ireland and EMEA.\n3. The net revenue generated by the Primalytics JV will be split 50/50 between Celes Delaware and Primeline.\n4. In addition to the 50% net revenue share, Primeline will have the option to convert their share of the JV net revenue into equity in Celes Delaware at the time of the Series A funding round. The conversion will be at the Series A valuation with a 20% discount, which aligns with your co-founder's suggestion and is similar to the YCombinator SAFE structure.\n\nThis proposal allows Primeline to benefit from both their initial investment in Celes Delaware and the revenue generated by the Primalytics JV while providing Celes Delaware with the opportunity to raise additional capital via the JV net revenue. The 20% discount on the conversion of JV revenue to equity at the Series A stage acknowledges the risk taken by Primeline and compensates them for the time value of money.\n\nBy using a discount on the Series A valuation for the conversion, both parties can benefit from the growth of Celes without excessively diluting your ownership or putting an unfair burden on your company.\n\nI hope this proposal can help you find common ground with Primeline and create a successful partnership.

  "answer": "If you have a computer network running Windows XP and you've discovered Palevo malware on one of the machines, there are several risks associated with it:\n\n1. Propagation within the network: Although your network is disconnected from the internet, the malware can still spread to other computers within the network via shared drives, removable media, or other local connections.\n2. Exploitation of vulnerabilities: Windows XP is an outdated operating system, and Microsoft stopped providing official support and security updates in 2014. This makes your computers more vulnerable to attacks, as many security patches have not been applied.\n3. Data theft or corruption: The Palevo malware can potentially steal sensitive data or corrupt files on the infected computers. It could also modify system settings or registry entries, leading to system instability.\n4. Loss of productivity: The presence of malware can cause system slowdowns or crashes, resulting in reduced productivity for users working on the infected computers.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, consider taking the following steps:\n\n1. Isolate the infected computer(s) from the rest of the network to prevent further spread of the malware.\n2. Use an antivirus software to scan and remove the malware from the affected computers. Keep in mind that you may need to use an updated antivirus tool, as many providers have dropped support for Windows XP.\n3. Backup any essential data and consider migrating to a more modern and supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or a Linux distribution. This will provide better security and ensure that you receive regular updates to protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities.\n4. Implement security best practices on your network, such as regularly updating software, using strong passwords, and limiting user privileges to prevent unauthorized access.\n5.
