**User Profile**</br>
1. 是否需要加入过去的学习经历？不同专业背景之间可能差异显著，这种信息缺失可能影响对人物画像的准确性。</br>
    举例来说，有人本科阶段学习机械，硕士阶段专注于自动化，博士阶段转向计算机研究。如果仅关注最高学历，这可能导致教育背景/兴趣分析出现偏差。</br>
2. 兴趣爱好的分析似乎不够深入，难以全面覆盖个人的真实兴趣？这或许与中西方文化差异有关。</br>
1. Should past educational experiences be included? Significant differences in professional backgrounds might exist, and such information gaps could affect the accuracy of the personal profile.</br>
    For instance, someone might study mechanical engineering during their undergraduate studies, specialize in automation at the master’s level, and switch to computer science for their PhD. Focusing only on the highest degree could lead to biases in analyzing educational background or interests.</br>
2. The analysis of interests seems insufficiently detailed, making it challenging to fully encompass a person’s true interests. This might be attributed to cultural differences between the East and the West.</br>

**Unreasonable sample**</br>
Method: Use GPT-4 to check if the user profile is reasonable. If the user profile is reasonable, print “OK”; otherwise, print the reasons why the profile is unreasonable.</br>
code: check_validity.py</br>
result: profile_evaluation_results.json</br>
user_id: user_95</br>


**QA generation**</br>
result:</br>
1.The questions and answers generated using GPT automatically are mostly centered around the user profile, lacking diversity in the questions. Perhaps we need to find ways to improve this.</br>
2.Some completely unrealistic Q&A have appeared, and I have commented them in QA1.yaml.</br>

How can we match user profiles with Q&A?</br>
What questions do we need?</br>
